Vision - sample app for [Advanced Express Web Application Development](http://www.packtpub.com/advanced-express-web-application-development/book) by Andrew Keig

NOTE: ```logs/run.log``` (outside of version control) MUST exist at the root level when migrating

FIXME: crashing behaviour above

NOTE: GITHUB_VISION_TOKEN needs to exist in process.env
